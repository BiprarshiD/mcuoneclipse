----------
Project for the LPC804 using driving two on-board LEDs (red and green) plus WS2812B LEDs, connected to PIO0_8.
For the WS2812B the PLU of the LPC804 is used. For this the PLU code from olikraus
(https://github.com/olikraus/lpc804_plu/tree/master/lpc804) has been used for the PLU tables,
and everything has been ported to the MCUXpresso SDK and the NXP PLU tool

The LPC804.xml file is the data file for the NXP PLU Tool.
